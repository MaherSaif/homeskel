# dpc's home directory skeleton

## Introduction

This directory contains home skeleton that I use for my Linux accounts.

Each time I'm given a new Linux system to work on or a shell account somewhere
I clone this repository to make my working environment the one that I'm used to.

Many things are tailored for my personal needs, but as I at least try to keep
things sane and simple I've decided to publish my work.

## Warning

Storing your configuration files under revision control system like git is
considered very unsafe. If you're working with a remote system you can easily
cut off any means to connect to a remote box. Even on the local system it's easy
to cause problems.

You have been warned.

## Support

In case of any questions please just drop me an email: dpc@ucore.info

## Integrated screen support

By default each remote connection is wrapped into the screen shell. This way I
don't have to remember to launch screen manually.

I've described this idea on my Wiki:
http://dpc.ucore.info/forum/t-220201/gnu-screen-as-a-default-shell-for-remote-account

This feature have been under constant development and is working very smoothly
now.

All the work is handled in the `~/.bashrc.screen`. 

You can prevent and force this behavior creating a file or using Unix
environment variables.

## Other features / preferences

* vim config, bash in vim mode
* git aliases
* bash aliases
* ssh wrappers for screen
* .nobackup files for rdup
* possibly others

## Deployment

This is how I deploy my scripts on new systems.

* `cd $HOME`
* wget -o CLONE.sh http://github.com/dpc/homeskel/raw/master/.CLONE.sh
* run `sh CLONE.sh`
* fix any issues and re-run `sh CLONE.sh` till ready

However I advise you to clone my repository first, then change the default URL
that is used in CLONE.sh.

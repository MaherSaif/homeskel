# dpc's home directory skeleton

## Introduction

This directory contains home skeleton that I use for my Linux accounts.

Each time I'm given a new Linux system to work on or a shell account somewhere
I clone this repository to make my working environment the one that I'm used to.

Many things are tailored for my personal needs, but as I at least try to keep
things sane and simple I've decided to publish my work.

## Warning

Storing your configuration files under revision control system like git is
considered very unsafe. If you're working with a remote system you can easily
cut off any means to connect to a remote box. Even on the local system it's easy
to cause problems.

You have been warned.

## Support

In case of any questions please just drop me an email: dpc@ucore.info

## Integrated screen/tmux support

By default each remote connection is wrapped into the screen/tmux shell. This
way I don't have to remember to launch screen/tmux manually.

I've described this idea on my Wiki:
http://dpc.ucore.info/forum/t-220201/gnu-screen-as-a-default-shell-for-remote-account

This feature have been under constant development and is working very smoothly
now.

All the work is handled in the `~/.bashrc.screen` or `~/.bashrc.tmux`.

You can prevent and force this behavior creating a file or using Unix
environment variables.

## Other features / preferences

* vim config, bash in vim mode
* git aliases
* bash aliases
* ssh wrappers for screen/tmux
* .nobackup files for rdup
* possibly others
* custom scripts should be put in `$HOME/.bin`
* home installed software goes to `$HOME/opt` while sources from
  which it is being built go under `$HOME/opt/src`

## Deployment

This is how I deploy my scripts on new systems.

* `cd $HOME`
* `wget -O CLONE.sh http://github.com/dpc/homeskel/raw/master/.CLONE.sh`
* run `sh CLONE.sh`
* while they are still any issues: fix them any re-run `sh CLONE.sh`

However I advise you to clone my repository first, then change the default URL
that is used in CLONE.sh.
